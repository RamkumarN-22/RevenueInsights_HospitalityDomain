# Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing revenue data within the hospitality industry, specifically targeting AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels across India. Facing declining market share and revenue due to competitive pressures and management challenges, AtliQ Grands seeks to leverage Business and Data Intelligence to regain its position in the luxury/business hotel segment. The goal is to provide actionable insights through data analysis and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze historical booking and revenue data to identify trends and patterns.
- Develop key performance metrics such as Occupancy Rate, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR).
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize insights and support decision-making.
- Recommend strategies to improve revenue and market share.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The analysis utilizes the following datasets:

- **dim_date.csv**: Contains date-related information for temporal analysis.
- **dim_hotels.csv**: Details about hotel properties, including location and type.
- **dim_rooms.csv**: Information on room types and characteristics.
- **fact_bookings.csv**: Records of individual bookings with associated details.
- **fact_aggregated_bookings.csv**: Aggregated booking data for summary analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI.

## 📈 Key Metrics

- **Occupancy Rate**: Percentage of occupied rooms over a period.
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: Average revenue earned per occupied room per day.
- **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**: Revenue generated per available room, regardless of occupancy.
- **Cancellation Rate**: Percentage of bookings that were canceled.
- **Average Rating**: Customer satisfaction score based on reviews.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Hotel-wise Analysis**: Insights into individual hotel performance metrics.
- **Room Type Distribution**: Analysis of revenue and occupancy by room types.
- **Booking Trends**: Seasonal and temporal patterns in bookings and cancellations.

## 🔍 Insights Derived

- There is minimal variation in pricing between weekdays and weekends, indicating a fixed pricing strategy.
- Mumbai leads in revenue generation, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
